weewx-celestial change history
------------------------------

2.4 Release 2025/01/28
----------------------
Bugfix for index out of range when moon phase is new moon.

2.3 Release 2025/01/18
----------------------
- Add update_rate_secs field to the Celestial section of weewx.conf to limit updating to every 10s (by default).

2.2 Release 2025/01/12
----------------------
- Rework code to make it testable.
- Add a test which can be invoked with:
  PYTHONPATH=bin/user:/home/weewx/bin python -m celestial --test --out-temp=65.1 --barometer=30.128
  PYTHONPATH=bin/user:/home/weewx/bin python -m celestial --test --out-temp=18.4 --barometer=1020.25 --metric
- Add more type annotations and pass mypy check (in addition to pyflakes3).
- To be safe, make sure no skyfield exception are raised to WeeWX.  Rather,
  catch them and report in the log.
  Note: if the init successfully loads the ephemneris, these exceptions are
        not expected.  This is just a safety measure in case there are coding errors.
- Add footnote to sample report that the report uses Skyfield and JPL's ephemeris.
